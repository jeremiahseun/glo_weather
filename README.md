A demo app for getting weather of cities and states.

## Getting Started

### This app uses the openweather API to get the weather. If you want to run the app, kindly go to [OpenWeather Website](https://openweathermap.org) and get an API key for the app functionality.

### This app is built with Flutter and the Dart Language. A simple app that show two screens.
- The first is to input the City name
- The second shows the tempertature of the city. Then it shows it in a heatmap graph.
